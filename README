What is iTALC?
----------------

iTALC is a use- and powerful didactical tool which lets you view and control
computers in your labs and interact with students in a modern way.

iTALC has been designed for usage in school.
Therefore it offers a lot of possibilities to teachers, such as

  * see what's going on in computer-labs by using overview mode and make snapshots
  * remote-control computers to support and help other people
  * show a demo (either in fullscreen or in a window) - the teacher's screen is
    shown on all student's computers in realtime
  * lock workstations for moving undivided attention to teacher
  * send text-messages to students
  * powering on/off and rebooting computers per remote
  * remote logon and logoff and remote execution of arbitrary commands/scripts
  * home-schooling - iTALC's network-technology is not restricted to a subnet
    and therefore students at home can join lessons via VPN-connections just by
    installing iTALC client software



How to build, install and setup iTALC
---------------------------------------
