*  LibVNCServer (C) 2001 Johannes E. Schindelin <Johannes.Schindelin@gmx.de>
is based on
*  Original OSXvnc (C) 2001 Dan McGuirk <mcguirk@incompleteness.net>,
which in turn is based on
*  Original Xvnc (C) 1999 AT&T Laboratories Cambridge.

Lots of improvements of this library are thanks to
* TightVNC (C) 2000-2003 Const Kaplinsky

The ZRLE compression scheme is from
* RealVNC (James "Wez" Weatherall, who helped also with regions)

The good folks from
* KRFB (Dscho thinks it was Tim Jansen)
helped also a lot (some *big* bugs!).

Karl Runge provided an x11vnc, which is a much, much improved version of Dscho's
original proof-of-concept. It really deserves to replace the old version,
as it is a state-of-the-art, fast and usable program by now!

The file transfer protocol from TightVNC was implemented by Rohit Kumar.
This includes an implementation of RFB protocol version 3.7t.

Probably we forgot quite a few people sending a patch here and there, which
really made a difference. Without those, some obscure bugs still would
be unfound.
