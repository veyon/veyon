	git clone --recursive https://github.com/veyon/veyon.git && cd veyon


### Installing dependencies

Requirements for Debian-based distributions:

- Build tools: g++ libc6-dev make cmake dpkg-dev
- Qt5: qtbase5-dev qtbase5-private-dev qtbase5-dev-tools qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools qtdeclarative5-dev qtquickcontrols2-5-dev

- libjpeg: libjpeg-dev provided by libjpeg-turbo8-dev or libjpeg62-turbo-dev
- zlib: zlib1g-dev
- OpenSSL: libssl-dev
- PAM: libpam0g-dev
- procps: libprocps-dev
- LZO: liblzo2-dev
- QCA: libqca-qt5-2-dev
- LDAP: libldap2-dev
- SASL: libsasl2-dev

As root you can run

	apt install g++ libc6-dev make cmake qtbase5-dev qtbase5-private-dev \
	            qtbase5-dev-tools qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools \
	            qtdeclarative5-dev qtquickcontrols2-5-dev libfakekey-dev \
	            xorg-dev libxtst-dev libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libpam0g-dev \
	            libprocps-dev liblzo2-dev libqca-qt5-2-dev libldap2-dev \
	            libsasl2-dev ninja-build

NOTE: On Ubuntu 24, ``libprocps-dev`` is replaced with ``libproc2-dev``.

Requirements for RedHat-based distributions:

- Build tools: gcc-c++ make cmake rpm-build
- Qt5: qt5-devel qt5-qtbase-private-devel
- X11: libXtst-devel libXrandr-devel libXinerama-devel libXcursor-devel libXrandr-devel libXdamage-devel libXcomposite-devel libXfixes-devel libfakekey-devel
- libjpeg: libjpeg-turbo-devel
- zlib: zlib-devel
- OpenSSL: openssl-devel
- PAM: pam-devel
- procps: procps-devel
- LZO: lzo-devel
- QCA: qca-devel qca-qt5-devel
- LDAP: openldap-devel
- SASL: cyrus-sasl-devel

As root you can run

	dnf install gcc-c++ make cmake rpm-build qt5-devel libXtst-devel libXrandr-devel libXinerama-devel libXcursor-devel \
             libXrandr-devel libXdamage-devel libXcomposite-devel libXfixes-devel libfakekey-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel zlib-devel \
             openssl-devel pam-devel procps-devel lzo-devel qca-devel qca-qt5-devel openldap-devel cyrus-sasl-devel ninja-build


### Configuring and building sources

Run the following commands:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make -j4

NOTE: To use Qt5 instead of Qt6, pass ``-DWITH_QT6=OFF`` to ``cmake``.

NOTE: If you want to build a .deb or .rpm package for this software, instead of the provided cmake command, you should use:

	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..

to install package files in /usr instead of /usr/local.

If some requirements are not fullfilled, CMake will inform you about it and
you will have to install the missing software before continuing.

You can now generate a package (.deb or .rpm depending what system you are in).

For generating a package you can run

	fakeroot make package

Then you'll get something like veyon_x.y.z_arch.deb or veyon-x.y.z.arch.rpm

Alternatively you can install the built binaries directly (not recommended for
production systems) by running the following command as root:

	make install

### Arch linux

A PKGBUILD can be found in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/veyon/).

### PPA

This PPA contains official Veyon packages for Ubuntu suitable for use both on desktop computers and ARM boards (e.g. Raspberry Pi). Even though only packages for LTS releases are available they should work for subsequent non-LTS releases as well.

	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:veyon/stable
	sudo apt-get update
	
### openSUSE

Veyon is available on official openSUSE Tumbleweed repository.

	sudo zypper in veyon
	
For openSUSE Leap 15.2, use the unofficial package from Education repository.
	 
	 https://software.opensuse.org/package/veyon?search_term=veyon

## Join development

If you are interested in Veyon, its programming, artwork, testing or something like that, you're welcome to participate in the development of Veyon!

Before starting the implementation of a new feature, please always open an issue at https://github.com/veyon/veyon/issues to start a discussion about your intended implementation. There may be different ideas, improvements, hints or maybe an already ongoing work on this feature.

## Join translation team

Veyon and its documentation are translated at the Transifex platform. Please go to https://www.transifex.com/veyon-solutions/veyon and join the corresponding translation team. Please DO NOT submit pull requests for modified translation files since this would require manual Transifex synchronizations on our side.
