	Replace TightVNC encoder with TurboVNC encoder. This patch is the
	result of further research and discussion that revealed the
	following: -- TightPng encoding and the rfbTightNoZlib extension need not
	   conflict.  Since TightPng is a separate encoding type, not supported
	   by TurboVNC-compatible viewers, then the rfbTightNoZlib extension
	   can be used solely whenever the encoding type is Tight and disabled
	with the encoding type is TightPng.  -- In the TightVNC encoder, compression levels above 5 are basically
	   useless.  On the set of 20 low-level datasets that were used to
	   design the TurboVNC encoder (these include the eight 2D application
	   captures that were also used when designing the TightVNC encoder, as
	   well as 12 3D application captures provided by the VirtualGL
	   Project-- see
	   http://www.virtualgl.org/pmwiki/uploads/About/tighttoturbo.pdf),
	   moving from Compression Level (CL) 5 to CL 9 in the TightVNC
	   encoder did not increase the compression ratio of any datasets more
	   than 10%, and the compression ratio only increased by more than 5%
	   on four of them.  The compression ratio actually decreased a few
	   percent on five of them.  In exchange for this paltry increase in
	   compression ratio, the CPU usage, on average, went up by a factor of
	   5.  Thus, for all intents and purposes, TightVNC CL 5 provides the
	"best useful compression" for that encoder.  -- TurboVNC's best compression level (CL 2) compresses 3D and video
	   workloads significantly more "tightly" than TightVNC CL 5 (~70%
	   better, in the aggregate) but does not quite achieve the same level
	   of compression with 2D workloads (~20% worse, in the aggregate.)
	   This decrease in compression ratio may or may not be noticeable,
	   since many of the datasets it affects are not performance-critical
	   (such as the console output of a compilation, etc.) However, for
	   peace of mind, it was still desirable to have a mode that compressed
	   with equal "tightness" to TightVNC CL 5, since we proposed to
	replace that encoder entirely.  -- A new mode was discovered in the TurboVNC encoder that produces,
	   in the aggregate, similar compression ratios on 2D datasets as
	   TightVNC CL 5.  That new mode involves using Zlib level 7 (the same
	   level used by TightVNC CL 5) but setting the "palette threshold" to
	   256, so that indexed color encoding is used whenever possible.  This
	   mode reduces bandwidth only marginally (typically 10-20%) relative
	   to TurboVNC CL 2 on low-color workloads, in exchange for nearly
	   doubling CPU usage, and it does not benefit high-color workloads at
	   all (since those are usually encoded with JPEG.)  However, it
	provides a means of reproducing the same "tightness" as the TightVNC    encoder on 2D workloads without sacrificing any compression for
	   3D/video workloads, and without using any more CPU time than
	necessary.  -- The TurboVNC encoder still performs as well or better than the
	   TightVNC encoder when plain libjpeg is used instead of
	libjpeg-turbo.  Specific notes follow: common/turbojpeg.c common/turbojpeg.h: Added code to emulate the
	libjpeg-turbo colorspace extensions, so that the TurboJPEG wrapper
	can be used with plain libjpeg as well.  This required updating the
	TurboJPEG wrapper to the latest code from libjpeg-turbo 1.2.0,
	mainly because the TurboJPEG 1.2 API handles pixel formats in a much
	cleaner way, which made the conversion code easier to write.  It
	also eases the maintenance to have the wrapper synced as much as
	possible with the upstream code base (so I can merge any relevant
	bug fixes that are discovered upstream.) The libvncserver version of
	the TurboJPEG wrapper is a "lite" version, containing only the JPEG
	compression/decompression code and not the lossless transform, YUV
	encoding/decoding, and dynamic buffer allocation features from
	TurboJPEG 1.2.  configure.ac: Removed the --with-turbovnc option.  configure still
	checks for the presence of libjpeg-turbo, but only for the purposes
	of printing a performance warning if it isn't available.  rfb/rfb.h: Fix a bug introduced with the initial TurboVNC encoder
	patch.  We cannot use tightQualityLevel for the TurboVNC 1-100
	quality level, because tightQualityLevel is also used by ZRLE.
	Thus, a new parameter (turboQualityLevel) was created.  rfb/rfbproto.h: Remove TurboVNC-specific #ifdefs and language libvncserver/rfbserver.c: Remove TurboVNC-specific #ifdefs.  Fix
	afore-mentioned tightQualityLevel bug.  libvncserver/tight.c: Replaced the TightVNC encoder with the
	TurboVNC encoder.  Relative to the initial TurboVNC encoder patch,
	this patch also: -- Adds TightPng support to the TurboVNC encoder --
	   Adds the afore-mentioned low-bandwidth mode, which is mapped
	   externally to Compression Level 9 test/*: Included TJUnitTest (a regression test for the TurboJPEG
	wrapper) as well as TJBench (a benchmark for same.)  These are
	useful for ensuring that the wrapper still functions correctly and
	performantly if it needs to be modified for whatever reason.  Both
	of these programs are derived from libjpeg-turbo 1.2.0.  As with the
	TurboJPEG wrapper, they do not contain the more advanced features of
	TurboJPEG 1.2, such as YUV encoding/decoding and lossless
	transforms.

	* libvncserver/rfbserver.c: Fix an issue that affects the existing
	Tight encoder as well as the newly-implemented Turbo encoder.  The issue is that, when using the current libvncserver source, it is
	impossible to disable Tight JPEG encoding.  The way Tight/Turbo
	viewers disable JPEG encoding is by simply not sending the Tight
	quality value, causing the server to use the default value of -1.
	Thus, cl->tightQualityLevel has to be set to -1 prior to processing
	the encodings message for this mechanism to work.  Similarly, it is
	not guaranteed that the compress level will be set in the encodings
	message, so it is set to a default value prior to processing the
	message.

	* common/turbojpeg.c, common/turbojpeg.h, configure.ac,
	libvncserver/Makefile.am, libvncserver/rfbserver.c,
	libvncserver/turbo.c, rfb/rfb.h, rfb/rfbproto.h: Add TurboVNC
	encoding support.  TurboVNC is a variant of TightVNC that uses the same client/server
	protocol (RFB version 3.8t), and thus it is fully cross-compatible
	with TightVNC and TigerVNC (with one exception, which is noted
	below.) Both the TightVNC and TurboVNC encoders analyze each
	rectangle, pick out regions of solid color to send separately, and
	send the remaining subrectangles using mono, indexed color, JPEG, or
	raw encoding, depending on the number of colors in the subrectangle.
	However, TurboVNC uses a fundamentally different selection algorithm
	to determine the appropriate subencoding to use for each
	subrectangle.  Thus, while it sends a protocol stream that can be
	decoded by any TightVNC-compatible viewer, the mix of subencoding
	types in this protocol stream will be different from those generated
	by a TightVNC server.  The research that led to TurboVNC is described in the following
	report:
	http://www.virtualgl.org/pmwiki/uploads/About/tighttoturbo.pdf.  In
	summary:  20 RFB captures, representing "common" 2D and 3D
	application workloads (the 3D workloads were run using VirtualGL),
	were studied using the TightVNC encoder in isolation.  Some of the
	analysis features in the TightVNC encoder, such as smoothness
	detection, were found to generate a lot of CPU usage with little or
	no benefit in compression, so those features were disabled.  JPEG
	encoding was accelerated using libjpeg-turbo (which achieves a 2-4x
	speedup over plain libjpeg on modern x86 or ARM processors.)
	Finally, the "palette threshold" (minimum number of colors that the
	subrectangle must have before it is compressed using JPEG or raw)
	was adjusted to account for the fact that JPEG encoding is now quite
	a bit faster (meaning that we can now use it more without a CPU
	penalty.)  TurboVNC has additional optimizations, such as the
	ability to count colors and encode JPEG images directly from the
	framebuffer without first translating the pixels into RGB.  The
	TurboVNC encoder compares quite favorably in terms of compression
	ratio with TightVNC and generally encodes a great deal faster (often
	an order of magnitude or more.) The version of the TurboVNC encoder included in this patch is
	roughly equivalent to the one found in version 0.6 of the Unix
	TurboVNC Server, with a few minor patches integrated from TurboVNC
	1.1.  TurboVNC 1.0 added multi-threading capabilities, which can be
	added in later if desired (at the expense of making libvncserver
	depend on libpthread.) Because TurboVNC uses a fundamentally different mix of subencodings
	than TightVNC, because it uses the identical protocol (and thus a
	viewer really has no idea whether it's talking to a TightVNC or
	TurboVNC server), and because it doesn't support rfbTightPng (and in
	fact conflicts with it-- see below), the TurboVNC and TightVNC
	encoders cannot be enabled simultaneously.  Compatibility: In *most* cases, a TurboVNC-enabled viewer is fully compatible with
	a TightVNC server, and vice versa.  TurboVNC supports
	pseudo-encodings for specifying a fine-grained (1-100) quality scale
	and specifying chrominance subsampling.  If a TurboVNC viewer sends
	those to a TightVNC server, then the TightVNC server ignores them,
	so the TurboVNC viewer also sends the quality on a 0-9 scale that
	the TightVNC server can understand.  Similarly, the TurboVNC server
	checks first for fine-grained quality and subsampling
	pseudo-encodings from the viewer, and failing to receive those, it
	then checks for the TightVNC 0-9 quality pseudo-encoding.  There is one case in which the two systems are not compatible, and
	that is when a TightVNC or TigerVNC viewer requests compression
	level 0 without JPEG from a TurboVNC server.  For performance
	reasons, this causes the TurboVNC server to send images directly to
	the viewer, bypassing Zlib.  When the TurboVNC server does this, it
	also sets bits 7-4 in the compression control byte to rfbTightNoZlib
	(0x0A), which is unfortunately the same value as rfbTightPng.  Older
	TightVNC viewers that don't handle PNG will assume that the stream
	is uncompressed but still encapsulated in a Zlib structure, whereas
	newer PNG-supporting TightVNC viewers will assume that the stream is
	PNG.  In either case, the viewer will probably crash.  Since most
	VNC viewers don't expose compression level 0 in the GUI, this is a
	relatively rare situation.  Description of changes: configure.ac -- Added support for libjpeg-turbo.  If passed an
	   argument of --with-turbovnc, configure will now run (or, if cross-compiling, just link) a test program that determines
	   whether the libjpeg library being used is libjpeg-turbo.
	   libjpeg-turbo must be used when building the TurboVNC encoder,
	   because the TurboVNC encoder relies on the libjpeg-turbo
	   colorspace extensions in order to compress images directly out of
	   the framebuffer (which may be, for instance, BGRA rather than RGB.)
	   libjpeg-turbo can optionally be used with the TightVNC encoder as
	   well, but the speedup will only be marginal (the report linked above
	    explains why in more detail, but basically it's because of Amdahl's
	    Law.  The TightVNC encoder was designed with the assumption that
	JPEG had a very high CPU cost, and thus JPEG is used only
	sparingly.) -- Added a new configure variable, JPEG_LDFLAGS.  This
	   is necessitated by the fact that libjpeg-turbo often distributes
	   libjpeg.a and libjpeg.so in /opt/libjpeg-turbo/lib32 or
	   /opt/libjpeg-turbo/lib64, and many people prefer to statically
	   link with it.  Thus, more flexibility is needed than is provided by
	   --with-jpeg.  If JPEG_LDFLAGS is specified, then it overrides the
	   changes to LDFLAGS enacted by --with-jpeg (but --with-jpeg is
	   still used to set the include path.)  The addition of JPEG_LDFLAGS
	necessitated replacing AC_CHECK_LIB with AC_LINK_IFELSE (because
	   AC_CHECK_LIB automatically sets LIBS to -ljpeg, which is not what we
	want if we're, for instance, linking statically with libjpeg-turbo.)
	-- configure does not check for PNG support if TurboVNC encoding is
	   enabled.  This prevents the rfbSendRectEncodingTightPng() function
	   from being compiled in, since the TurboVNC encoder doesn't (and
	can't) support it.  common/turbojpeg.c, common/turbojpeg.h -- TurboJPEG is a simple API
	   used to compress and decompress JPEG images in memory.  It was
	   originally implemented because it was desirable to use different
	   types of underlying technologies to compress JPEG on different
	   platforms (mediaLib on SPARC, Quicktime on PPC Macs, Intel
	   Performance Primitives, etc.) These days, however, libjpeg-turbo
	   is the only underlying technology used by TurboVNC, so TurboJPEG's
	purpose is largely just code simplicity and flexibility.  Thus,
	   since there is no real need for libvncserver to use any technology
	   other than libjpeg-turbo for compressing JPEG, the TurboJPEG wrapper
	for libjpeg-turbo has been included in-tree so that libvncserver can
	   be directly linked with libjpeg-turbo.  This is convenient because
	   many modern Linux distros (Fedora, Ubuntu, etc.) now ship
	   libjpeg-turbo as their default libjpeg library.  libvncserver/rfbserver.c -- Added logic to check for the TurboVNC
	   fine-grained quality level and subsampling encodings and to map
	   Tight (0-9) quality levels to appropriate fine-grained quality level
	   and subsampling values if communicating with a TightVNC/TigerVNC
	viewer.  libvncserver/turbo.c -- TurboVNC encoder (compiled instead of
	libvncserver/tight.c) rfb/rfb.h -- Added support for the TurboVNC subsampling level rfb/rfbproto.h -- Added constants for the TurboVNC fine quality
	   level and subsampling encodings as well as the rfbTightNoZlib
	constant and notes on its usage.

	client_examples/gtkvncviewer.c, configure.ac: Here is a port of
	SDLvncviewer to GTK+2.  I think it may encourage people to implement more features for the
	viewer, because a GTK GUI seems to be easier to implement than a SDL
	one (and it is more integrated with the major Linux Desktops out
	there).  Signed-off-by: Christian Beier <dontmind@freeshell.org>

	to specify the ip address for reverse connections For security reasons, it can be important to limit which IP
	addresses a LibVNCClient-based client should listen for reverse
	connections. This commit adds that option.  To preserve binary backwards-compatibility, the field was added to
	the end of the rfbclient struct, and the function ListenAtTcpPort
	retains its signature (but calls the new ListenAtTcpPortAndAddress).  [jes: shortened the commit subject, added a longer explanation in

	* libvncserver/Makefile.am: Fix build error when libpng is
	available, but libjpeg is not.  The png stuff in tight.c depends on code in tight.c that uses
	libjpeg features. We could probably seperate that, but for now the
	dependency for 'tight' goes: PNG depends on JPEG depends on ZLIB.  This is reflected in Makefile.am now.  NB: Building tight.c with JPEG but without PNG is still possible,     but nor the other way around.

2011-10-26  Christian Beier <dontmind@freeshell.org>

	* libvncserver/rfbserver.c: Fix deadlock in threaded mode when using
	nested rfbClientIteratorNext() calls.  Lengthy explanation follows...  First, the scenario before this patch: We have three clients 1,2,3 connected. The main thread loops through
	them using rfbClientIteratorNext() (loop L1) and is currently at
	client 2 i.e. client 2's cl_2->refCount is 1. At this point we need
	to loop again through the clients, with cl_2->refCount == 1, i.e. do
	a loop L2 nested within loop L1.  BUT: Now client 2 disconnects, it's clientInput thread terminates
	its clientOutput thread and calls rfbClientConnectionGone(). This
	LOCKs clientListMutex and WAITs for cl_2->refCount to become 0. This
	means this thread waits for the main thread to release cl_2.
	Waiting, with clientListMutex LOCKed! Meanwhile, the main thread is about to begin the inner
	rfbClientIteratorNext() loop L2. The first call to
	rfbClientIteratorNext() LOCKs clientListMutex. BAAM. This mutex is
	locked by cl2's clientInput thread and is only released when
	cl_2->refCount becomes 0. The main thread would decrement
	cl_2->refCount when it would continue with loop L1. But it's waiting
	for cl2's clientInput thread to release clientListMutex. Which never
	happens since this one's waiting for the main thread to decrement
	cl_2->refCount. DEADLOCK.  Now, situation with this patch: Same as above, but when client 2 disconnects it's clientInput thread
	rfbClientConnectionGone(). This again LOCKs clientListMutex, removes
	cl_2 from the linked list and UNLOCKS clientListMutex. The WAIT for
	cl_2->refCount to become 0 is _after_ that. Waiting, with
	clientListMutex UNLOCKed! Therefore, the main thread can continue, do the inner loop L2 (now
	only looping through 1,3 - 2 was removed from the linked list) and
	continue with loop L1, finally decrementing cl_2->refCount, allowing
	cl2's clientInput thread to continue and terminate. The resources
	held by cl2 are not free()'d by rfbClientConnectionGone until
	cl2->refCount becomes 0, i.e. loop L1 has released cl2.

	* libvncserver/rfbserver.c: Fix memory leak I was debbuging some code tonight and i found a pointer that is not
	been freed, so i think there is maybe a memory leak, so it is...  there is the malloc caller reverse order: ( malloc cl->statEncList ) 	<- rfbStatLookupEncoding 	<- rfbStatRecordEncodingSent 	<- rfbSendCursorPos 	<- rfbSendFramebufferUpdate 	<- rfbProcessEvents I didnt look the whole libvncserver api, but i am using
	rfbReverseConnection with rfbProcessEvents, and then when the client
	connection dies, i am calling a rfbShutdownServer and
	rfbScreenCleanup, but the malloc at rfbStatLookupEncoding isnt been
	freed.  So to free the stats i added a rfbResetStats(cl) after
	rfbPrintStats(cl) at rfbClientConnectionGone in rfbserver.c before
	free the cl pointer. (at rfbserver.c line 555). And this, obviously,
	is correcting the memory leak.  Signed-off-by: Johannes Schindelin <johannes.schindelin@gmx.de>

	* rfb/rfbclient.h: Hopefully fix the crash when updating from 0.9.7
	or earlier For backwards-compatibility reasons, we can only add struct members
	to the end. That way, existing callers still can use newer
	libraries, as the structs are always allocated by the library (and
	therefore guaranteed to have the correct size) and still rely on the
	same position of the parts the callers know about.  Reported by Luca Falavigna.  Signed-off-by: Johannes Schindelin <johannes.schindelin@gmx.de>

	code.  Remove the UTF-8 encoding hack. This was really just an experiment.  If the protocol passed in the handshake has "binary" then don't
	base64 encode for the HyBi protocol. This will allow noVNC to
	request the binary data be passed raw and not base64 encoded.
	Unfortunately, the client doesn't speak first in VNC protocol (bad
	original design). If it did then we could determine whether to
	base64 encode or not based on the first HyBi frame from the client
	and whether the binary bit is set or not. Oh well.  Misc Cleanup: - Always free response and buf in handshake routine.  - Remove some unused variables.

	* libvncserver/rfbserver.c, libvncserver/websockets.c: websockets:
	Add UTF-8 encoding support.  This is not completely standard UTF-8 encoding. Only code points
	0-255 are encoded and never encoded to more than two octets. Since
	'\x00' is a WebSockets framing character, it's easier for all
	parties to encode zero as '\xc4\x80', i.e. 194+128, i.e. UTF-8 256.  This means that a random stream will be slightly more than 50%
	larger using this encoding scheme. But it's easy CPU-wise for client
	and server to decode/encode. This is especially important for
	clients written in languages that have weak bitops, like Javascript
	(i.e. the noVNC client).  Signed-off-by: Johannes Schindelin <johannes.schindelin@gmx.de>

2009-02-03  dscho <dscho>

	* Makefile.am, client_examples/Makefile.am, configure.ac,
	contrib/Makefile.am, examples/Makefile.am,
	libvncclient/Makefile.am, libvncserver/Makefile.am,
	test/Makefile.am, vncterm/Makefile.am, x11vnc/Makefile.am: clean up
	build flags The flag handling (both compiler options and include paths) are a
	mess at the moment.  There is no point in forcing "-O2 -g" when
	these are already the defaults, and if someone changes the defaults,
	chances are good they don't want you clobbering their choices.  The -Wall flag should be handled in configure and thrown into CFLAGS
	once rather than every Makefile.am.  Plus, this way we can control
	which compilers the flag actually gets used with.  Finally, the INCLUDES variable is for -I paths, not AM_CFLAGS.  Nor
	should it contain -I. as this is already in the default includes
	setup.  Signed-off-by: Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> Signed-off-by:

	* configure.ac: configure: use AM_PROG_CC_C_O Newer automakes error out due to per-file CFLAGS being used unless
	the macro AM_PROG_CC_C_O is set in configure.ac.  [jes: The macro AM_PROG_CC_C_O has been around since 1999, so it
	 should be safe.] Signed-off-by: Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> Signed-off-by:

	* autogen.sh: autogen.sh: run with set -e If any autotool command fails, we want to abort, not keep running.
	Otherwise, errors in say a Makefile.am will be missed as the
	automake failure gets ignored and then lost in the noise.  Signed-off-by: Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> Signed-off-by:

	* AUTHORS, ChangeLog, libvncserver/main.c, libvncserver/rfbserver.c: 
	Fix a locking problem in libvncserver There seems to be a locking problem in libvncserver, with respect to
	how condition variables are used.  On certain machines in our lab, when using a vncviewer to view a
	display that has a very high rate of updates, we will occasionally
	see the VNC server process crash.  In one stack trace that was
	obtained, an assertion had tripped in glibc's pthread_cond_wait,
	which was called from clientOutput.  Inspection of clientOutput suggests that WAIT is being called
	incorrectly.  The mutex that protects a condition variable should
	always be locked when calling wait, and on return from the wait will
	still be locked.  The attached patch fixes the locking around this
	condition variable, and one other that I found by grepping the
	source for similar occurrences.  Signed-off-by: Charles Coffing <ccoffing@novell.com>

	* TODO: update TODO

2005-10-07  dscho <dscho>

	* examples/backchannel.c, libvncserver/rfbserver.c, rfb/rfb.h: The
	PseudoEncoding extension code was getting silly: If the client asked for an encoding, and no enabled extension
	handled it, LibVNCServer would walk through all extensions, and if
	they promised to handle the encoding, execute the extension's
	newClient() if it was not NULL.  However, if newClient is not NULL, it will be called when a client
	connects, and if it returns TRUE, the extension will be enabled.
	Since all the state of the extension should be in the client data,
	there is no good reason why newClient should return FALSE the first
	time (thus not enabling the extension), but TRUE when called just
	before calling enablePseudoEncoding().  So in effect, the extension got enabled all the time, even if that
	was not necessary.  The resolution is to pass a void** to enablePseudoEncoding. This has
	the further advantage that enablePseudoEncoding can remalloc() or
	free() the data without problems. Though keep in mind that if
	enablePseudoEncoding() is called on a not-yet-enabled extension, the
	passed data points to NULL.

	* ChangeLog, libvncserver/cargs.c, libvncserver/main.c,

	* ChangeLog, contrib/zippy.c, examples/example.c,
	libvncserver/cursor.c, libvncserver/main.c,
	libvncserver/rfbserver.c, libvncserver/selbox.c, rfb/rfb.h,
	vncterm/VNConsole.c, x11vnc/x11vnc.c: pointerClient was still
	static.  do not make requestedRegion empty without reason.  the cursor handling for clients which don't handle CursorShape
	updates was completely broken. It originally was very complicated
	for performance reasons, however, in most cases it made performance
	even worse, because at idle times there was way too much checking
	going on, and furthermore, sometimes unnecessary updates were
	inevitable.  The code now is much more elegant: the ClientRec structure knows
	exactly where it last painted the cursor, and the ScreenInfo
	structure knows where the cursor shall be.  As a consequence there is no more rfbDrawCursor()/rfbUndrawCursor(),
	no more dontSendFramebufferUpdate, and no more isCursorDrawn.  It is
	now possible to have clients which understand CursorShape updates
	and clients which don't at the same time.  rfbSetCursor no longer has the option freeOld; this is obsolete, as
	the cursor structure knows what to free and what not.
