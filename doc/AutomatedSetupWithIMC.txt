Automated setup with the iTALC Management Console (IMC)
=======================================================

The iTALC Management Console (IMC) allows to configure an iTALC installation
easily. The IMC provides an easy to use graphical user interface where all
iTALC-related settings can be made.

This document describes how a computer can be setup for the use of iTALC
automatically. All instructions refer to an automated setup on Windows but
should be identical on Linux except platform-specific characteristics such
as path delimiter, installation paths etc.


1) Prepare a global common directory which can be accessed by all computers
   in the network. Alternatively, a directory on an USB drive works as well.


2) Install iTALC on the master computer. Afterwards run the IMC and alter the
   settings according to your needs and your environment.

   In the "Authentication" area, launch the iTALC access key assistant and
   let it create an access key pair and export the public key to the directory
   prepared in step 1)


3) Create an iTALC client reference installation. Afterwards run the IMC and
   alter the settings according to your needs and your environment. Then save
   the settings via "File" -> "Save settings into file" to the directory
   prepared in step 1) and choose a filename, e.g. ClientSettings.xml


4) Copy the content of the installation directory (e.g. all files in
   C:\Program Files\iTALC\) to the directory prepared in step 1).


5) Write a batch file with the following commands and place it in the same
   directory as the files in the previous steps.

     mkdir "C:\Program Files\iTALC"
     cp *.exe *.dll *.txt *.xml "C:\Program Files\iTALC\"
     cd "\Program Files\iTALC"
     imc -ApplySettings ClientSettings.xml
     imc -ImportPublicKey PublicKey.key.txt
     ica -RegisterService
     ica -StartService

   After running this batch file on a client, the client should be ready for use
   with the iTALC network.
